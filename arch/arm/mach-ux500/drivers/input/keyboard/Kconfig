	  This driver implements support for buttons connected
	  to GPIO pins of various CPUs (and some other chips).

	  Say Y here if your device has buttons connected
	  directly to such GPIO pins.  Your board-specific
	  setup logic must also provide a platform device,
	  with configuration data saying which GPIOs are used.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called gpio_keys.

	  This driver implements support for buttons connected
	  to GPIO pins that are not capable of generating interrupts.

	  Say Y here if your device has buttons connected
	  directly to such GPIO pins.  Your board-specific
