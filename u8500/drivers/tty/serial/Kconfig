config SERIAL_AMBA_PL010_U8500
	tristate "ARM AMBA PL010 serial port support"
	depends on ARM_AMBA && (BROKEN || !ARCH_VERSATILE)
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  This selects the ARM(R) AMBA(R) PrimeCell PL010 UART.  If you have
	  an Integrator/AP or Integrator/PP2 platform, or if you have a
	  Cirrus Logic EP93xx CPU, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_AMBA_PL010_CONSOLE_U8500
	bool "Support for console on AMBA serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_AMBA_PL010_U8500=y
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you wish to use an AMBA PrimeCell UART as the system
	  console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel
	  messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode).

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible framebuffer console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyAM0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

config SERIAL_AMBA_PL011_U8500
	tristate "ARM AMBA PL011 serial port support"
	depends on ARM_AMBA
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  This selects the ARM(R) AMBA(R) PrimeCell PL011 UART.  If you have
	  an Integrator/PP2, Integrator/CP or Versatile platform, say Y or M
	  here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_AMBA_PL011_CONSOLE_U8500
	bool "Support for console on AMBA serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_AMBA_PL011_U8500=y
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you wish to use an AMBA PrimeCell UART as the system
	  console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel
	  messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode).

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible framebuffer console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyAMA0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)
